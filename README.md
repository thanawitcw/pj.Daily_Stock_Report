Data Consolidation and Stock Quantity Calculator
This Python project aims to streamline data management and analysis for business users. 
It cleans and combines data from multiple Excel files, fetches additional data from a Microsoft Access database, performs calculations using pandas and NumPy, and standardizes the dataset to produce a final Excel report. 

The output contains key insights, including:
- Product information (supplier name, supply chain owner name)
- Stock quantity by SKU
- In-transit order quantity
- Stock cover date by SKU (Stock DOH)
The goal of this project is to provide business users with accurate and actionable data to inform decision-making.
